description: How to write social media posts for Droppy (Reddit, ProductHunt, etc.)
---

When writing posts for Reddit, ProductHunt, or other platforms:

1. **Be natural and human** – avoid robotic/AI phrasing. Write like you're talking to a friend.
2. **Stay humble** – don't oversell. Let the product speak for itself.
3. **Be genuine** – mention it's a passion project, open-source, built by one person if relevant.
4. **Keep it concise** – respect people's time. Get to the point.
5. **Don't use buzzwords** – skip the marketing fluff like "revolutionary" or "game-changing".
6. **Show personality** – a bit of humor or self-deprecation is fine.
7. **Be specific** – mention actual features, not vague promises.

Example tone:
- ✅ "Been working on this for months and finally shipped it. Would love feedback!"
- ❌ "Introducing the revolutionary new productivity solution that will transform your workflow."

Example opener:
- ✅ "I built a free Mac app that adds a file shelf to your notch. Here's what it does..."
- ❌ "Droppy is an innovative all-in-one productivity companion designed to enhance your macOS experience."
