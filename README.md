## What is Droppy?

Droppy is a **free, open-source** macOS app that gives you a temporary file shelf right in your notch. Drop files there while you navigate to their destination — no more juggling Finder windows or cluttering your desktop.

Built with the new **Liquid Glass** design language from macOS Tahoe, Droppy feels native and beautiful.

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install iordv/tap/droppy
```

### Manual Download

1. Download [`Droppy.dmg`](https://github.com/iordv/Droppy/raw/main/Droppy.dmg)
2. Drag `Droppy.app` to your Applications folder
3. Right-click → Open (required for unsigned apps)

## Features

### 🗂️ Notch File Shelf
Drop files onto the notch area and they'll stay there until you need them. The shelf expands smoothly to show your files with beautiful animations.

### ✨ Liquid Glass Design
Built for macOS 26 Tahoe with the new Liquid Glass aesthetic — translucent materials, smooth animations, and that signature refractive look.

### 🔄 File Conversion
Right-click any file to convert between formats:
- **Images**: PNG ↔ JPEG, HEIC → JPEG/PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF
- **Documents**: Word, Excel, PowerPoint → PDF (works out of the box via Cloudmersive API)

### 💾 Quick Save
Right-click any file in the shelf and choose "Save" to quickly save it to a location of your choice.

### ⚙️ Customizable
- Launch at login
- Menu bar icon toggle
- Transparent background option for a cleaner look

### 🔒 Privacy-First
- No analytics or tracking
- Document conversion uses the secure Cloudmersive API (files are processed in memory and not stored)
- All other files stay local on your Mac

## Usage

1. **Add files**: Drag files onto the notch area — it glows to show it's ready
2. **View shelf**: Hover over the notch or click to expand
3. **Use files**: Drag files out to their destination
4. **Convert files**: Right-click → Convert to...
5. **Clear shelf**: Click the trash icon or drag files out

## Requirements

- **macOS 26.0 (Tahoe)** or later
- Mac with a notch (MacBook Pro 14"/16", MacBook Air M2/M3)

> **Note**: Since Droppy isn't code-signed, you'll need to right-click → Open on first launch, or run:
> ```bash
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Droppy.app
> ```

## Document Conversion Setup (Local Fallback)

Droppy uses the Cloudmersive API for PDF conversions out of the box. If you prefer to keep everything local or hit the API limits, you can run a local Gotenberg instance as a fallback:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3001:3000 gotenberg/gotenberg:8
```

Image conversions work natively without any additional setup.
