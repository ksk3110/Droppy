# Droppy 4.7.3 - Precise Drop Zone

## Bug Fixes
- **Fixed drop zone blocking bookmark bar**: The shelf's drop zone now only activates when hovering directly over the real hardware notch. Previously, the drop zone extended too far below the notch, preventing users from dragging files/URLs to browser bookmark bars and other UI elements near the top of the screen.
- **Fixed invisible indicator text**: The "Drop!" and "Open Shelf" indicator text is now always white, ensuring visibility regardless of transparency mode settings.

## Improvements
- **Subtler notch expansion**: Reduced the notch expansion height when dragging files from 40px to 16px for a more refined, less intrusive visual effect.
