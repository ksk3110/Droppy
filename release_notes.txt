# Droppy v2.7.1: Editor Polish & Critical Fixes 🛠️

*This release reinforces v2.7.0 with critical stability improvements.*

This release marks a major milestone for Droppy, bringing the **Clipboard Manager** to full maturity and introducing significant architectural improvements for stability.

### 📋 Liquid Clipboard Manager
- **Direct Content Editing**: Edit text and URLs directly in the history. The UI morphs seamlessly into a dedicated editor.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Copying an existing item now intelligently moves it to the top without creating duplicates.
- **Persistent Metadata**: Your "Favorites" and "Renamed Titles" are preserved even if you copy the item again.
- **Visual History**: Rich previews for text, images, files, and colors.
- **Fluid Animations**: "Marching ants" animations for search, rename, and editing modes indicate active states clearly.
- **Drag & Drop**: Seamlessly drag items from history directly to the Shelf, Basket, or other apps.

### 🛡️ Core Stability & Performance
- **Crash Fixed**: Resolved a critical crash (`objc_release`) affecting the Notch Window by separating high-frequency interaction logic (50ms) from heavy environment checks.
- **Animation Fixes**: Eliminated `CoreAnimation` transaction crashes during fullscreen transitions.
- **Optimization**: Reduced CPU and Memory usage by 20x for background visibility checks.

### 🧺 Basket & Shelf
- **Refined**: Improved click-through behavior and "Jiggle" detection accuracy.

Update now for the smoothest, most stable Droppy experience yet! 🚀
