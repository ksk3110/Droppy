## Features
- **Auto-Shrink Shelf**: The notch shelf now automatically collapses after a configurable delay (3-30 seconds) when the mouse leaves the area. Enabled by default.
- New "Shelf Behavior" section in Display settings to configure auto-shrink timing

## Fixes
- Fixed Share submenu positioning in context menus
- Silenced deprecation warnings for share services API (required for proper SwiftUI context menu integration)
