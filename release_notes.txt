Stability (v2.1.4): Hardened window animations to eliminate rare `objc_release` crashes.
Fixed: Refactored animation logic to bypass unstable background DisplayLink threads.
Unified: All window transitions now use main-thread safe synchronization.
Maintenance: Continuous improvement for the rock-solid Droppy experience.
