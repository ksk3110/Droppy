### Version 4.5.0

**Visual & Interface Refinements**
- **MacBook Notch Compatibility**: Fixed an issue where volume percentage and media timestamps were partially obscured by the physical MacBook notch on supported displays.
- **Instant Settings Previews**: Rewrote the GIF preview system in Settings to use a high-performance in-memory cache. Feature previews now load with zero latency when navigating settings.

**Technical Improvements**
- Improved `GIFPreloader` to decode assets on background threads at app startup.
- Enhanced `AnimatedGIFView` to check for cached assets before attempting network requests.
- Optimized horizontal padding in `NotchHUDView` and `MediaHUDView` for better visual balance on internal MacBook displays.
